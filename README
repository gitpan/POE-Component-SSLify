ABSTRACT
            Makes SSL use in POE a breeze!

DESCRIPTION
    This component represents the standard way to do SSL in POE.

NOTES
  Socket methods doesn't work
    The new socket this module gives you actually is some tied socket magic,
    so you cannot do stuff like getpeername() or getsockname(). The only way
    to do it is to use SSLify_GetSocket and then operate on the socket it
    returns.

  Dying everywhere...
    This module will die() if Net::SSLeay could not be loaded or it is not
    the version we want. So, it is recommended that you check for errors and
    not use SSL, like so:

            eval { use POE::Component::SSLify };
            if ( $@ ) {
                    $sslavailable = 0;
            } else {
                    $sslavailable = 1;
            }

            # Make socket SSL!
            if ( $sslavailable ) {
                    eval { $socket = POE::Component::SSLify::Client_SSLify( $socket ) };
                    if ( $@ ) {
                            # Unable to SSLify the socket...
                    }
            }

  Mixing Server/Client in the same program
            Some users have reported success, others failure when they tried to utilize SSLify in both roles. This
            would require more investigation, so please tread carefully if you need to use it!

FUNCTIONS
  Client_SSLify
            Accepts a socket, returns a brand new socket SSLified. Optionally accepts SSL
            context data.
                    my $socket = shift;                                             # get the socket from somewhere
                    $socket = Client_SSLify( $socket );                             # the default
                    $socket = Client_SSLify( $socket, $version, $options );         # sets more options for the context
                    $socket = Client_SSLify( $socket, undef, undef, $ctx );         # pass in a custom context

            If $ctx is defined, SSLify will ignore other args. If $ctx isn't defined, SSLify
            will create it from the $version + $options parameters.

            Known versions:
                    * sslv2
                    * sslv3
                    * tlsv1
                    * default

            By default we use the version: default

            By default we don't set any options

            NOTE: The way to have a client socket with proper certificates set up is:
                    my $socket = shift;     # get the socket from somewhere
                    my $ctx = SSLify_ContextCreate( 'server.key', 'server.crt' );
                    $socket = Client_SSLify( $socket, undef, undef, $ctx );

            BEWARE: If you passed in a CTX, SSLify will do Net::SSLeay::CTX_free( $ctx ) when the
            socket is destroyed. This means you cannot reuse contexts!

  Server_SSLify
            Accepts a socket, returns a brand new socket SSLified
                    my $socket = shift;     # get the socket from somewhere
                    $socket = Server_SSLify( $socket );

            NOTE: SSLify_Options must be set first!

  SSLify_Options
            Accepts the location of the SSL key + certificate files and does it's job

            Optionally accepts the SSL version + CTX options
                    SSLify_Options( $key, $cert, $version, $options );

            Known versions:
                    * sslv2
                    * sslv3
                    * tlsv1
                    * default

            By default we use the version: default

            By default we use the options: &Net::SSLeay::OP_ALL

  SSLify_GetCTX
            Returns the server-side CTX in case you wanted to play around with it :)

            If passed in a socket, it will return that socket's $ctx instead of the global.
                    my $ctx = SSLify_GetCTX();                      # get the one set via SSLify_Options
                    my $ctx = SSLify_GetCTX( $sslified_sock );      # get the one in the object

  SSLify_GetCipher
            Returns the cipher used by the SSLified socket

            Example:
                    print "SSL Cipher is: " . SSLify_GetCipher( $sslified_sock ) . "\n";

  SSLify_GetSocket
            Returns the actual socket used by the SSLified socket, useful for stuff like getpeername()/getsockname()

            Example:
                    print "Remote IP is: " . inet_ntoa( ( unpack_sockaddr_in( getpeername( SSLify_GetSocket( $sslified_sock ) ) ) )[1] ) . "\n";

  SSLify_ContextCreate
            Accepts some options, and returns a brand-new SSL context object ( $ctx )
                    my $ctx = SSLify_ContextCreate();
                    my $ctx = SSLify_ContextCreate( $key, $cert );
                    my $ctx = SSLify_ContextCreate( $key, $cert, $version, $options );

            Known versions:
                    * sslv2
                    * sslv3
                    * tlsv1
                    * default

            By default we use the version: default

            By default we don't set any options

            By default we don't use the SSL key + certificate files

EXPORT
            Stuffs all of the above functions in @EXPORT_OK so you have to request them directly

BUGS
    On Win32 platforms SSL support is pretty shaky, please help me out with
    detailed error descriptions if it happens to you!

PROPS
            Original code is entirely Rocco Caputo ( Creator of POE ) -> I simply
            packaged up the code into something everyone could use and accepted the burden
            of maintaining it :)

            From the PoCo::Client::HTTP code =]
            # TODO - This code should probably become a POE::Kernel method,
            # seeing as it's rather baroque and potentially useful in a number
            # of places.
